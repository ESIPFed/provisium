# Provisium ala THROUGHPUT

## About

The work for the NSF EarthCube Thoughput funded project
resulted in a major change to the Provisium code base.  I must
confess I was confused how best to integrate this work and not end
up with a forked Provisium. 

To resolve this I simply made the Throughput version the main version 
and deprecated the old code.   I'll work to integrate any remaining
features from the old Provisium then.   

I believe this is best since it provides an example of how to use
Provisium code in other groups or settings.   That is why this 
directory is placed in "examples".
